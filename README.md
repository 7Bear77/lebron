This is a pet-project that I am working on throughout the duration of learning Web Development.
I am starting this project on February 15 2025, and will be attempting to implement everything that I learn directly
into this web-page. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of the concepts that I am learning by applying them 
while learning them. This web-page should be good enough to be a portfolio piece when I am finished with it.
The subject matter is something that I find to be important. LeBron James is my favorite Basketball player of all time
and I would like to have an omage to his great NBA career. When I am completed this should be a one-stop-shop for everything
you need to know about the historic career of LeBron James.

As an added note; If you are viewing this page before completion, I will unlikely to be adding content in a historically 
chronological order, and will get around to each season of his career in due time.

Thank you for reading.
